                <h1>Welcome</h1>
                Thank you for participating in the AFABL programmer study. We have integrated reinforcement learning in a programming language called AFABL (A Friendly Adaptive Behavior Language). AFABL is domain-specific language (DSL)/framework shallowly-embedded (read: no crazy special syntax) in the Scala programming language which allows you to use the basic concepts of the reinforcement learning problem -- states, actions and rewards -- while knowing very little about reinforcement learning algorithms.<br>
                <br>
                In this study we ask you to anonymously write two agents twice -- once in Scala and once in AFABL -- and analyze the code to make quantitative comparisons between agent programs written in Scala and agent programs written in AFABL. At the end of the study we also ask you to answer 10 short reflective questions about your impressions of agent programming in Scala and AFABL. The study shouldn't take more than an hour or two.<br>
                <br>
                If you choose to provide us with your email address, which is completely optional, we will enter you into a drawing for a $100 Amazon gift card. Your email address will only be used for the gift card drawing. We will not associate any personally identifying information with your submitted code.<br>

                  <h4>Purpose</h4>

                    <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>

                    To participate in this study, you must be comfortable writing Scala programs using IntelliJ.

                    <h4>Procedures</h4>

                    You will write agents in Scala and AFABL (A Friendly Adaptive Behavior Language) to solve two progressively more complex programming tasks. AFABL is a Scala- embedded language/library that integrates reinforcement learning concepts and algorithms.

                    <h4>Risks or Discomforts</h4>

                    There is little to no risk associated with this research study beyond the normal use of a computer for programming.

                    <h4>Benefits</h4>

                    You are not likely to benefit in any direct way from participating in this study. You will learn new forms of programming, which may benefit you.

                    <p>Thank you for participating in this study! Our goal is to quanitify the advantage or disadvantage of a shallowly embedded Scala DSL for agent programming. You will be helping to shape the future of AI language design.</p>

                    <h2>Study Mechanics</h2>

                    <p>Download <span id="afabl_study_download">afabl_study.zip</span>.</p>

                    <p>You will need Intellij IDEA (Build #IC-162.2032.8) with the Scala plugin. You will also need to install the <a href="https://github.com/kjcartledge/Bunny/releases/download/1.0/Bunny.jar">Bunny plugin</a>. If you need help setting this up, please follow the instructions found <a href="https://github.com/kjcartledge/Bunny/blob/master/GettingStarted.md" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>You will place your code in four files, all of which have been provided for you:</p>

                    <ul>
                    <li><code>src/main/scala/org/afabl/study/AfablTask1.scala</code></li>
                    <li><code>src/main/scala/org/afabl/study/AfablTask2.scala</code></li>
                    <li><code>src/main/scala/org/afabl/study/scalaTask1.scala</code></li>
                    <li><code>src/main/scala/org/afabl/study/scalaTask2.scala</code></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>You should complete these tasks in a specific order: <code>AfablTask1</code>, then <code>AfablTask2</code>, then <code>scalaTask1</code> and finally <code>scalaTask2</code>. Write the Scala agents using your knowledge of Scala. Before you write your AFABL agents, read the short AFABL tutorial at <a href="http://afabl.org/">http://afabl.org/</a>.</h3>

                    <p>A build configuration has been provided for you named "Run." You simply have to click the green run arrow to test your work, which will bring up a menu like this:</p>

                    <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>Multiple main classes detected, <span class="pl-k">select</span> <span class="pl-smi">one</span> to run:

 [1] org.afabl.study.AfablTask1
 [2] org.afabl.study.AfablTask2
 [3] org.afabl.study.ScalaTask1
 [4] org.afabl.study.ScalaTask2

Enter number:</pre></div>

                    <p>Enter the number corresponding to the task you'd like to run, and your agent will get a score. When you're happy with that score you can move on to the next agent. Don't spend too much time trying to get a good score. This is not a competition. We're only trying to get feedback on programmers' experiences writing agent programs using a traditional programming language and using AFABL.</p>

                    <p>When you have completed all four agents, in IntelliJ IDEA select <em>Tools</em> followed by <em>Bunny</em> then <em>Submit</em> to complete the study and submit your results.</p>

                    <p>If this fails, you can use the <em>Export Results</em> option instead of <em>Submit</em> to generate a text file. You can email these results to study@afabl.org.</p>

                    <h2>Your Tasks</h2>

                    <p>You will write four simple agents: two agents in Scala and two in AFABL (A Friendly Adaptive Behavior Language). Skeleton code for each agent has been provided, as well as the code to represent states and actions. Don't spend much time optimizing your agents. Any score above 0.3 is fine, and if you've spent more than 45 minutes on a single agent, move on to the next agent no matter what your current agent's score is. This is not a competition and we don't associate your code with any identifying information, even if you provided your email address.</p>

                    <h3>Task 1: Bunny-Food-Wolf</h3>

                    <pre><code>+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   | W |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+
| F |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+
|   | B |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+</code></pre>

                    <p>In the grid world above, the bunny (B) must pursue two goals simultaneously: find food (F) and avoid the wolf (W).  The bunny may move up, down, left, or right.  When it finds food it consumes the food and new food appears elsewhere in the grid world, when it meets the wolf it is eaten and "respawns" elsewhere.</p>

                    <p>The bunny world works as follows:</p>

                    <ul>
                    <li>The bunny world is a discrete grid of cells.  The bunny, wolf, and food each occupy one cell.</li>
                    <li>During each time step the bunny may move north, south, east, or west -- this is the bunny agent's action set.</li>
                    <li>Every two time steps the wolf moves towards the bunny.</li>
                    <li>If the bunny moves to the cell currently occupied by the food, the agent should be written to recognize this fact and give the agent an appropriate reward signal. In any case the simulation assumes food is "eaten" and new food appears elsewhere.</li>
                    <li>If the wolf moves to the cell currently occupied by the bunny it eats the bunny and the bunny "respawns" in a new location.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>For Task 1 write an agent that controls the bunny. The bunny should meet the wolf as little as possible and eat as much food as possible.</p>

                    <h3>Task 2: Mating Bunny</h3>

                    <pre><code>+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   | W |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+
| F |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   | M |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+
|   | B |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+</code></pre>

                    <p>For Task 2 write a bunny agent for a world that is identical to the world in Task 1 except that the bunny must also find mates.  This world includes one static potential mate (M) that behaves similarly to the food.  When the bunny finds the potential mate, the simulation assumes that the bunny has "mated," the mate disappears, and another potential mate appears elsewhere.  The simulation runs as in Task 1, and the scorer additionally keeps track of how many mates the bunny finds.  As in Task 1, programmers were asked to write bunny agents that meet the wolf as little as possible, eat as much food as possible, and find as many mates as possible.</p>

                    <p>Thank you for participating in this study! Our goal is to quanitify the advantage or disadvantage of a shallowly embedded Scala DSL for agent programming. You will be helping to shape the future of AI language design.</p>

                    <h2>Study Mechanics</h2>

                    <p>Download <span id="scala_study_download">afabl_study.zip</span>.</p>

                    <p>You will need Intellij IDEA (Build #IC-162.2032.8) with the Scala plugin. You will also need to install the <a href="https://github.com/kjcartledge/Bunny/releases/download/1.0/Bunny.jar">Bunny plugin</a>. If you need help setting this up, please follow the instructions found <a href="https://github.com/kjcartledge/Bunny/blob/master/GettingStarted.md"  target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>You will place your code in four files, all of which have been provided for you:</p>

                    <ul>
                    <li><code>src/main/scala/org/afabl/study/AfablTask1.scala</code></li>
                    <li><code>src/main/scala/org/afabl/study/AfablTask2.scala</code></li>
                    <li><code>src/main/scala/org/afabl/study/scalaTask1.scala</code></li>
                    <li><code>src/main/scala/org/afabl/study/scalaTask2.scala</code></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>You should complete these tasks in a specific order: <code>scalaTask1</code>, then <code>scalaTask2</code>, then <code>AfablTask1</code> and finally <code>AfablTask2</code>. Write the Scala agents using your knowledge of Scala. Before you write your AFABL agents, read the short AFABL tutorial at <a href="http://afabl.org/">http://afabl.org/</a>.</h3>

                    <p>A build configuration has been provided for you named "Run." You simply have to click the green run arrow to test your work, which will bring up a menu like this:</p>

                    <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>Multiple main classes detected, <span class="pl-k">select</span> <span class="pl-smi">one</span> to run:

 [1] org.afabl.study.AfablTask1
 [2] org.afabl.study.AfablTask2
 [3] org.afabl.study.ScalaTask1
 [4] org.afabl.study.ScalaTask2

Enter number:</pre></div>

                    <p>Enter the number corresponding to the task you'd like to run, and your agent will get a score. When you're happy with that score you can move on to the next agent. Don't spend too much time trying to get a good score. This is not a competition. We're only trying to get feedback on programmers' experiences writing agent programs using a traditional programming language and using AFABL.</p>

                    <p>When you have completed all four agents, in IntelliJ IDEA select <em>Tools</em> followed by <em>Bunny</em> then <em>Submit</em> to complete the study and submit your results.</p>

                    <p>If this fails, you can use the <em>Export Results</em> option instead of <em>Submit</em> to generate a text file. You can email these results to study@afabl.org.</p>

                    <h2>Your Tasks</h2>

                    <p>You will write four simple agents: two agents in Scala and two in AFABL (A Friendly Adaptive Behavior Language). Skeleton code for each agent has been provided, as well as the code to represent states and actions. Don't spend much time optimizing your agents. Any score above 0.3 is fine, and if you've spent more than 45 minutes on a single agent, move on to the next agent no matter what your current agent's score is. This is not a competition and we don't associate your code with any identifying information, even if you provided your email address.</p>

                    <h3>Task 1: Bunny-Food-Wolf</h3>

                    <pre><code>+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   | W |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+
| F |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+
|   | B |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+</code></pre>

                    <p>In the grid world above, the bunny (B) must pursue two goals simultaneously: find food (F) and avoid the wolf (W).  The bunny may move up, down, left, or right.  When it finds food it consumes the food and new food appears elsewhere in the grid world, when it meets the wolf it is eaten and "respawns" elsewhere.</p>

                    <p>The bunny world works as follows:</p>

                    <ul>
                    <li>The bunny world is a discrete grid of cells.  The bunny, wolf, and food each occupy one cell.</li>
                    <li>During each time step the bunny may move north, south, east, or west -- this is the bunny agent's action set.</li>
                    <li>Every two time steps the wolf moves towards the bunny.</li>
                    <li>If the bunny moves to the cell currently occupied by the food, the agent should be written to recognize this fact and give the agent an appropriate reward signal. In any case the simulation assumes food is "eaten" and new food appears elsewhere.</li>
                    <li>If the wolf moves to the cell currently occupied by the bunny it eats the bunny and the bunny "respawns" in a new location.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>For Task 1 write an agent that controls the bunny. The bunny should meet the wolf as little as possible and eat as much food as possible.</p>

                    <h3>Task 2: Mating Bunny</h3>

                    <pre><code>+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   | W |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+
| F |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   | M |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+
|   | B |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+</code></pre>

                    <p>For Task 2 write a bunny agent for a world that is identical to the world in Task 1 except that the bunny must also find mates.  This world includes one static potential mate (M) that behaves similarly to the food.  When the bunny finds the potential mate, the simulation assumes that the bunny has "mated," the mate disappears, and another potential mate appears elsewhere.  The simulation runs as in Task 1, and the scorer additionally keeps track of how many mates the bunny finds.  As in Task 1, programmers were asked to write bunny agents that meet the wolf as little as possible, eat as much food as possible, and find as many mates as possible.</p>
